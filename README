this is kuvert, a wrapper around sendmail or other MTAs that
does pgp/gpg signing/signing+encrypting transparently, based
on the content of your public keyring(s) and your preferences.

how it works:
-------------

you have to get your MUA to use kuvert_mta_wrapper instead of executing
/usr/lib/sendmail (or similar). kuvert_mta_wrapper will spool the mail
in kuvert's queue, iff there is a suitable configuration file and the 
parameters passed to kuvert_mta_wrapper are consistent with sending mail
via sendmail.

kuvert is the tool that takes care of mangling the email. it reads the 
queue periodically and handles emails in the queue: signing or encrypting
the mail, then handing it over to /usr/lib/sendmail for transport.

(why a queue? because i thought it might be useful to make sure that none of
your emails leaves your system without kuvert handing it. you might be 
very paranoid, and kill kuvert whenever you leave your box (and remove
the keyrings as well).)

how to use kuvert in a nutshell: 
--------------------------------

you'll need a MTA which provides /usr/lib/sendmail with "common" options
(see the manpage for which are necessary). also you'll need a MUA which
can be instructed not to run /usr/lib/sendmail.

in a pinch you could rename /usr/lib/sendmail to something else, and install
kuvert_mta_wrapper as /usr/lib/sendmail. if you choose so, make double sure 
that your ~/.kuvert lists the name of the real sendmail binary as MTA.

installation:
-------------

on debian systems you may install just the kuvert package.

on other systems you need to do the following:

you need perl perl 5.004+, MIME-tools-4.124.tar.gz or later,
MIME-Base64-2.11.tar.gz or later, and MailTools-1.13.tar.gz or later
from your nearest CPAN archive and install them. get gpg and/or pgp2.x.
optional: get robert bihlmeyer's quintuple-agent, compile and install it.

run make, make install DESTDIR=/ as root
-> kuvert, kuvert_mta_wrapper and the two manpages will be installed
in /usr/bin and /usr/share/man/man1.

configuration:
--------------

read the manpages for kuvert(1) and kuvert_mta_wrapper(1), 
instruct your MUA to use kuvert_mta_wrapper, make the config file
~/.kuvert.

finally start kuvert and inject a testmail, look at the logs to check
if everything works correctly.

(historical note: kuvert came into existence in 1996 as pgpmail and
was used only privately until 99, when it was extended and renamed
to guard. some of my friends started using this software, and in 
2001 it was finally re-christened kuvert, extended even further
and debianized.)
