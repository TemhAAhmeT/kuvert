this is kuvert, a wrapper around sendmail or other MTAs that
does pgp/gpg signing/signing+encrypting transparently, based
on the content of your public keyring(s) and your preferences.

how to use kuvert in a nutshell: 
--------------------------------

on debian systems you may install just the kuvert package and
the rest of the  installation will be taken care of automatically.

on other systems you need to do the following:

you need perl perl 5.004+, MIME-tools-4.124.tar.gz or later,
MIME-Base64-2.11.tar.gz or later, and MailTools-1.13.tar.gz or later
from your nearest CPAN archive and install them. get gpg and/or pgp2.x.
optional: get robert bihlmeyer's quintuple-agent, compile and install it.

run make, make install DESTDIR=/ as root
-> kuvert, kuvert_mta_wrapper and the two manpages will be installed
in /usr/bin and /usr/share/man/man1.

read the manpages for kuvert(1) and kuvert_mta_wrapper(1), 
configure kuvert and go on from there.

(historical note: kuvert came into existence in 1996 as pgpmail and
was used only privately until 99, when it was extended and renamed
to guard. some of my friends started using this software, and in 
2001 it was finally re-christened kuvert, extended even further
and debianized.)
